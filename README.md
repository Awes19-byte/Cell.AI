# MalariaCLass
Binary Image Classification with **Tensorflow** and **EfficientNetB0** pre-trained model <br> 
This repo is a binary classification project that identify cells images as **_parasitized_** or **_uninfected_** cells from the thin blood smear slide images of segmented cells.<br>
# Prerequisites 
`Python 3.x`
`Tensorflow 2.x`
# Datasets<br>
The Malaria dataset contains a total of 27,558 cell images with equal instances of parasitized and uninfected<br>
